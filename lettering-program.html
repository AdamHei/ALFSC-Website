                The Albert Lea Figure Skating Club offers a lettering program, the primary purpose of which is to offer
                athletic status to figure skaters and recognize the accomplishment and time commitment of these
                individuals by giving a letter award. The time commitment of figure skating often prevents a studentâ€™s
                participation in many of the recognized high school sports programs. Varsity participation is often
                viewed as a measure of success by colleges and universities, and the ALFSC feels that the sport of
                skating should be recognized in a similar manner.
