                The Maas Colstrup Scholarship is awarded to graduating seniors of Albert Lea High School who are members
                of the Albert Lea Figure Skating Club. It was established by Leroy Maas and Carol Colstrup, both of whom
                were founding members of the ALFSC. Eligible applicants must go through a selection committee appointed
                by the Scholarship Guidance Counselor of Albert Lea High School, which will take into account the
                applicant’s financial need, number of years as a member of the Albert Lea Figure Skating Club,
                the number of United States Figure Skating Tests passed, and the number of years that the applicant
                volunteered as a helper for the Albert Lea Learn to Skate Program. An addendum will accompany this form
                of which the club’s president, secretary, and one of its coaches will verify the skater’s skating
                information by signing. Points shall be awarded as directed in the addendum.
                The Standard Albert Lea High School Application Form must also be completed.
