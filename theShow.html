                The members of the Albert Lea Figure Skating Club perform a show at the end of each season.
                This production is the result of numerous hours of work from the skaters, their coaches and parent volunteers.
                The annual show traditionally takes place one weekend in March, with a 7:00 pm Saturday performance and a 2:00 pm Sunday performance at the Albert Lea City Arena.
                The skaters vote on a theme for the next year's show at the annual spring banquet.
                All music, costumes, props, and set decorations are structured around this theme.
                The club's 2016 show, entitled "Lights, Camera, Skate" will take place on Saturday, March 5<sup>th</sup> and Sunday, March 6<sup>th</sup>, 2016.
