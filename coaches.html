                        I started skating with the club when I was 4 and skated through my senior year.
                        I enjoyed to compete I would do about 3 to 4 a year.
                        I skated with many different clubs to got extra ice time.
                        I am married to my husband Derek and we have 2  beautiful boys and live in Albert Lea.
                        I work as a hair stylist for over 11 years. In my spare time I enjoy spending my time with my family and being out on the lake.

                        I figure skated for 11 years and couldn't be more excited about joining the club once again!
                        My favorite thing about skating is the feeling of accomplishment you get after you excel
                        in a particular move, jump, or spin. I am excited to pass on my passion to the younger generation.
                        I recently moved back to Albert Lea after being away at school for 7 years.
                        I now work as a Physician Assistant in Orthopedics at Mayo Clinic Health Systems, Albert Lea.

                        I started skating in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade with the Rochester Figure Skating Club.
                        I continue to skate and am currently focusing on ice dancing. I have participated in freestyle,
                        moves-in-the-field, synchronized skating, and ice dancing. Outside of skating I enjoy running, working out,
                        and teaching. I currently am an Interventionist at Hawthorne elementary school here in
